# Weekend Movies Saga

## Description

Duration: 3 days

This is a movie inventory which shows a list of all movies and their titles. Once a movie poster is clicked, the app navigates to a page with more information about the movie, including a description, genres and the option to delete the movie from the database. Another page allows you to add a new movie to the list.

## Installation

1. Create a database named `saga_movies_weekend`,
2. The queries in the `tables.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. I recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries,
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
